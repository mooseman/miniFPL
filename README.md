# miniFPL
A lexer (and soon a parser and interpreter) for a small FP language. 
Public domain. 

Plans - The first version of the interpreter will probably have syntax  
that is somewhat similar to Miranda(tm). However, for guards I'm 
leaning towards Haskell's syntax. 
Both Miranda and Haskell have very clean and elegant syntax. 


This code is released to the public domain.
